# Pico_Detection_Aparatus
#Items Being used: Raspberry Pi Pico W and 9G Servo
#All code and necessary functions to make Raspberry Pi detect a Raspberry Pi Pico's Position.
 #COMConfig.py defines what COM port the Pi Pico is connected to.
 #newmpu.py defines the parameters for the Pi Pico.
 #servo.py defines the parameters for the servo and sets the max angle for them.
 #PiPico.py defines the parameters for reading serial from the Pi Pico coordinates in whole numbers.
 #test.py is the file that controls the angles that each servo is reading and moves them where the Pi Pico is being manually moved to.
